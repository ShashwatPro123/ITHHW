That’s why robots are being proposed as security agents as they can protect humans, and they wouldn’t be in danger like human security guards would be. Currently, robotics companies are working on pairing robot guards with human security consultants. A very famous company in this field is Knightscope in the United States that has autonomous security robots capable of assisting human security guards with real-time, actionable intelligence. These robots can help with crimes such as armed robberies, burglaries, domestic violence, fraud, hit, and runs, etc.

                                        <h4><span class="thin">There are many things in space that are very dangerous for astronauts to do. Humans can’t roam on Mars all day to collect soil samples or work on repairing a spaceship from the outside while it’s in deep space! In these situations, robots are a great choice because there are no chances for the loss of human life then. So space institutions like NASA frequently use robots and autonomous vehicles to do things that humans can’t. For example, Mars Rover is an autonomous robot that travels on Mars and takes pictures of Martian rock formations that are interesting or important and then sends them back on Earth for the NASA scientists to study.

However, agriculture is also a seasonal sector that is dependent on ideal weather conditions optimal soil, etc. Moreover, there are many repetitive tasks in agriculture that are just a waste of farmer’s time and can be performed more suitable by robots. These include seeding, weed control, harvesting, etc. Robots are usually used for harvesting the crops which allow farmers to be more efficient. An example of a robot that is used to remove weeds in farms is the Ecorobotix. It is powered by solar energy and can be used to target and spray weeds using a complex camera system.
